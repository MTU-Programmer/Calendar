# Calendar with Easter Date and Hard Copy Printout

![Alt text](calendar.jpg?raw=true "Calendar")

This is the C# version of my calendar program, (in June 2017 I wrote a similar version in PHP). 
This C# version can display a calendar of 12 months for any year from 1583 to 2099, and also the date of Easter Sunday. 
The program includes a feature to allow you to print the calendar on paper or to send the calendar text to a PDF driver, (if you have one installed).

Written in Microsoft Visual C# 2013. The complete source code is included.
